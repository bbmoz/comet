<h1>Comet</h1>
Spawn comets that can consume DOM elements and can react to the "gravitational" pulls of these elements.

Despite this being a fun simulation, it conveys the color scheme of a specific web page as well as greater emphasis placed on certain DOM elements over others.

<h2>TODO</h2>
- Spawn comet in DOM (user clicks location, drags for initial velocity)
- Comet consumes colliding elements
  - grows in size but also slows down (comet can eventually stop due to a slow speed and opposing forces of "gravity" from different elements)
  - comet trail becomes more colorful based off the consumed elements' colors
- Comet is attracted by "large" elements and moves automatically
- Multiple comets can be spawned
- User can right click on a comet to remove it from the DOM
